# DailyForge — Product Overview

## What DailyForge Is
DailyForge is a lightweight, free productivity app focused on helping users define and complete **one meaningful goal per day**.  
The app is intentionally minimal to reduce friction and encourage daily adoption.

## What DailyForge Is Not
- Not a habit tracker with complex workflows
- Not a task manager or to-do list
- Not a premium, feature-gated app
- Not a widget-first experience

## Core Loop
1. User sets one daily focus
2. User completes the focus
3. App provides clear end-of-life (EOL) feedback
4. Day resets automatically
5. Streaks and stats update passively

## Monetization Philosophy
- All functional features are free
- Monetization is cosmetic only (themes)
- No data or insights are paywalled

## Long-Term Vision
DailyForge is one data signal within a broader Forge ecosystem designed to power future personal analytics and insights.
