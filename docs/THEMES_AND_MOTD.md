# DailyForge — Themes & MOTD Specification

## Theme Purpose
Themes control visual presentation only.
They must never affect functional behavior.

## What Themes Control
- Color palette
- Typography
- Motion intensity
- Completion feedback style
- MOTD tone and copy

## What Themes Must NOT Control
- Goal logic
- Streak logic
- Stats calculations
- App behavior

## MOTD (Message of the Day)
- Displayed passively
- Tone is theme-dependent
- Copy may rotate but must not block interaction

## Monetization
- Themes are unlocked via one-time IAP
- Themes apply across all supported platforms
- Ownership is represented as an entitlement

## OTA Compatibility
Themes should be safe to update via over-the-air updates without app resubmission.
