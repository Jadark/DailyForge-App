# DailyForge Migration Summary

**Date:** Current Session  
**Status:** Core Functionality Complete, Ready for Testing  
**Next Steps:** Theme system, IAP integration, History view

---

## Project Context

This is a controlled migration of DailyForge from SwiftUI to Expo (React Native + TypeScript). The SwiftUI app serves as the behavioral reference, but its code is not available in this repository.

### Key Constraints
- **Match behavior exactly** before any optimization or redesign
- **No new features** during migration
- **No UX changes** unless explicitly requested
- **Functionality is free**; monetization is cosmetic only (themes)
- **Widgets are paused** and out of scope
- **Streak and stats logic must not be altered**
- **Themes must be data-driven** and never affect behavior

### Source of Truth
All behavioral specifications are in `/docs`:
- `PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` - Core product philosophy
- `DAILYFORGE_BEHAVIOR.md` - Daily goal lifecycle and completion rules
- `STREAKS_AND_STATS.md` - Streak calculation and stats tracking
- `THEMES_AND_MOTD.md` - Theme system (visual only, no behavior impact)
- `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` - Migration strategy and constraints

---

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- **TypeScript Types** (`types/index.ts`)
  - `Goal`, `GoalDetail`, `GoalStatus`
  - `Stats` (currentStreak, longestStreak, totalCompleted, lastCompletedDate)
  - `UserProfile` (name, createdAt)
  - `AppState` (isOnboardingComplete, lastOpenedDate, notificationsEnabled)
  - `DailyRecord` (for history/archiving)

- **Storage Service** (`services/storage.ts`)
  - AsyncStorage wrapper with type-safe operations
  - Functions for user profile, current goal, stats, app state, daily records
  - Error handling and default values
  - Default AppState includes `notificationsEnabled: true`

- **Date Utilities** (`services/date-utils.ts`)
  - Local timezone date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Day comparisons (isSameDay, isYesterday, isToday, isBefore)
  - Day of year calculation (for MOTD selection)
  - Time of day detection (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Greeting generation based on time
  - Rollover detection
  - Streak calculation helpers

- **MOTD Data** (`data/default-motd.ts`)
  - 20 default MOTD messages
  - Deterministic selection based on day of year (modulo)
  - Same MOTD for entire day, changes at midnight

- **Midday Affirmations** (`data/default-midday-affirmations.ts`)
  - 10 positive affirmation messages
  - Random selection for 2:30 PM notification
  - Theme-ready structure

- **Evening Congratulations** (`data/default-evening-congratulations.ts`)
  - 10 congratulatory messages
  - Random selection for completed goals (non-milestone days)
  - Theme-ready structure

- **Color Constants** (`constants/colors.ts`)
  - Apple system colors for card states
  - Gray (empty), Blue (in progress), Green (completed)
  - Light/dark mode support

### Phase 2: Onboarding ✅
- **Onboarding Screen** (`app/onboarding.tsx`)
  - Name input field
  - Notification permission request (after name saved)
  - Marks onboarding complete and navigates to home

### Phase 3: User Profile & Settings ✅
- **useUserProfile Hook** (`hooks/use-user-profile.ts`)
  - Load, update username
  - Persists to storage

- **Settings Screen** (`app/settings.tsx`)
  - Edit username
  - Notification toggle switch (iOS-style)
  - Toggle updates immediately and persists preference
  - Modal presentation

### Phase 4: MOTD System ✅
- **useMOTD Hook** (`hooks/use-motd.ts`)
  - Returns today's MOTD deterministically
  - Based on day of year

### Phase 5: Goal & Stats Management ✅
- **useDailyGoal Hook** (`hooks/use-daily-goal.ts`)
  - Set goal for today
  - Mark complete / mark not complete
  - Add detail (append-only)
  - Check rollover and archive previous day's goal
  - Validates goal is from today

- **useStats Hook** (`hooks/use-stats.ts`)
  - Track current streak, longest streak, total completed
  - Record completion (increments streak if consecutive)
  - Revert completion (when marking not complete)
  - Updates longestStreak when current streak exceeds it
  - Increments totalCompleted on each completion
  - Streak calculation follows exact rules from docs

- **useAppState Hook** (`hooks/use-app-state.ts`)
  - Manages onboarding status
  - Tracks last opened date for rollover detection

### Phase 6: Home Screen UI ✅
- **Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
  - Time-based greeting ("Good Morning/Afternoon/Hello <username>")
  - MOTD display
  - Goal card component
  - Stats display (Current Streak, Highest Streak, Total Goals Completed)
  - EOL (End of Life) message when completed
  - Pull-to-refresh for rollover check
  - Settings button in header
  - Refreshes profile and goal when returning from other screens

- **Goal Card Component** (`components/goal-card.tsx`)
  - Three states:
    - **Empty (Gray)**: "Tap to set your goal for today"
    - **In Progress (Blue)**: Shows goal text, "Add Details" button, "Complete" button
    - **Completed (Green)**: Shows goal text, "✓ Completed" badge
  - Details icon indicator (📝) when details exist
  - iOS medium widget-style appearance
  - Entire card is pressable (opens Focus View)
  - Buttons work independently without blocking card press

- **Goal Input Modal** (`components/goal-input-modal.tsx`)
  - Modal for entering new goal
  - Character limit (200)
  - Save/Cancel buttons

### Phase 7: Focus View ✅
- **Focus Modal** (`app/focus-modal.tsx`)
  - Slide-up modal presentation
  - Displays goal text (read-only)
  - Shows all details/notes added that day
  - **In Progress State:**
    - Can add new details (append-only)
    - Cannot edit existing details or goal
    - Input field stays visible above keyboard
  - **Completed State:**
    - Read-only view
    - "Mark Not Complete" button to revert state
  - Details show timestamp
  - Keyboard handling with SafeAreaView and KeyboardAvoidingView
  - Loading state while goal data loads

### Phase 8: Day Rollover ✅
- **Rollover Logic** (in `useDailyGoal`)
  - Checks on app open and screen focus
  - Archives previous day's goal to daily records
  - Clears current goal if from previous day
  - Updates last opened date
  - MOTD automatically updates (deterministic by day)

### Phase 9: Notifications ✅
- **Notification Service** (`services/notifications.ts`)
  - Permission request
  - Respects `notificationsEnabled` preference from AppState
  - Three daily notifications:
    - **10:30 AM**: MOTD + "Set your goal" reminder (only if no goal set)
      - Cancels when goal is set
      - Uses tomorrow's MOTD for the notification
    - **2:30 PM**: Random midday positive affirmation
      - Always sends (regardless of goal state) if notifications enabled
      - Randomly selects from 10 affirmations
    - **8:30 PM**: Contextual notification based on goal state and streak
      - **Goal not set/not complete + streak < 7**: "You still have time to complete your goal for today"
      - **Goal not set/not complete + streak >= 7**: "You still have time to complete your goal today and keep that streak going"
      - **Goal complete + streak = 3**: "Congratulations! You have completed your goal 3 days in a row!"
      - **Goal complete + streak in [7, 14, 21, 35, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 365]**: Milestone celebration message
      - **Goal complete (other)**: Random congratulatory message from list of 10
  - Cancels morning reminder when goal is set
  - Updates evening notification when goal is completed
  - Initialization on app mount
  - All notification functions check `notificationsEnabled` preference

## Key Behavioral Rules Implemented

### Goal Lifecycle
- ✅ Exactly one goal per local calendar day
- ✅ Goal persists until completed or day rollover
- ✅ Goal can be completed once per day
- ✅ Completion triggers streak increment (if consecutive)
- ✅ Day rollover at local midnight archives previous goal

### Streak Logic
- ✅ Streak = consecutive days with completed goals
- ✅ Missing a day resets streak to zero
- ✅ Streak increments only once per calendar day
- ✅ Completion must occur before local midnight
- ✅ Historical stats remain intact on reset
- ✅ Longest streak is tracked and updated when current streak exceeds it

### Stats Tracking
- ✅ Current streak: Consecutive days with completed goals
- ✅ Longest streak: Highest streak achieved (never decreases)
- ✅ Total completed: Total number of goals completed (increments on each completion)
- ✅ Stats displayed on home screen in two-line format

### Details/Notes
- ✅ Append-only (cannot edit or delete)
- ✅ Cannot edit goal text after creation
- ✅ When completed, details become read-only
- ✅ Can mark not complete to revert and add more details
- ✅ Input field stays visible above keyboard when typing

### MOTD
- ✅ Deterministic selection (same MOTD all day)
- ✅ Changes at midnight
- ✅ Based on day of year modulo list length

### Greeting
- ✅ 5:00 AM - 11:59 AM: "Good Morning <username>"
- ✅ 12:00 PM - 4:59 PM: "Good Afternoon <username>"
- ✅ 5:00 PM - 4:59 AM: "Hello <username>"
- ✅ Updates dynamically as time changes
- ✅ Updates immediately when returning from settings

### Notifications
- ✅ User preference toggle in settings (enabled by default)
- ✅ All notifications respect user preference
- ✅ Morning reminder (10:30 AM): Only if no goal set
- ✅ Midday affirmation (2:30 PM): Random selection, always sends if enabled
- ✅ Evening contextual (8:30 PM): Contextual based on goal state and streak
- ✅ Notifications can be enabled/disabled instantly from settings

---

## What's Next / TODO

### Future Phases (Not Started)
1. **Theme System**
   - Data-driven theme definitions
   - Theme-specific MOTD, midday affirmations, and evening congratulations lists
   - Visual customization only (no behavior changes)
   - IAP integration for theme unlocks

2. **Additional Features** (Post-Migration)
   - History view (daily records)
   - Stats screen with detailed analytics
   - Widget support (iOS/Android)

---

## Testing Notes

- All linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- TypeScript types are properly defined
- Storage operations have error handling
- Date operations use local timezone consistently
- Rollover logic tested for edge cases
- Notification logic fully implemented and tested
- Keyboard handling works on iOS and Android
- Stats tracking verified (current, longest, total)

### Known Limitations
- Completion rate calculation is simplified (would need daily records history)
- No data migration from SwiftUI app (acceptable per migration notes)
- Notification scheduling happens on app initialization (may need background task for reliability)

---

## Important Reminders

1. **Behavioral Reference**: SwiftUI app is the source of truth for behavior
2. **No Optimizations Yet**: Match behavior first, optimize later
3. **Themes Are Cosmetic**: Never affect functional behavior
4. **Streak Logic Is Sacred**: Do not alter streak calculation rules
5. **Data Reset Acceptable**: Early users may experience data reset during migration

---

## Quick Reference: Key Functions

### Setting a Goal
```typescript
const { setGoal } = useDailyGoal();
await setGoal("Learn TypeScript generics");
```

### Completing a Goal
```typescript
const { markComplete } = useDailyGoal();
const { recordCompletion } = useStats();
await markComplete();
await recordCompletion();
```

### Adding a Detail
```typescript
const { addDetail } = useDailyGoal();
await addDetail("Made progress on understanding variance");
```

### Checking Rollover
```typescript
const { checkRollover } = useDailyGoal();
await checkRollover(); // Archives previous day if needed
```

### Toggling Notifications
```typescript
// In settings, handled automatically
// Preference stored in AppState.notificationsEnabled
```
